Classic World of Darkness Character Sheet Storage

The users for this is, initally, a close group of freinds that play the tabletop RPG 'Classic World of Darkness'; I've promised an online version of the charachter seet before, but without the tools to provide persistence, it wasn't possible. Firebase provides the answer. Users will be able to simplify the complex creation process, recall, and edit sheets, which ordinarily must be done on an antiquated and difficult PDF file.

Features:
Basic:
- Create a simple sheet
- Save sheet under user's name
- Load saved sheets
Optional Goals:
- Modular sheets (extra categories on the sheet can be added or subtracted by user)
- Automatic math for point expendatures
- Permissions-based viewing and editing (user validation)
- Exporting sheets to PDF or other format

Dependances:

-Firebase

Wireframe:

Since this project is replicating an existing document as an interactive app, the original document serves as the wireframe. Document is included as .pdf file in this repository.


Tasks:
* Set up scaffold
* Create Firebase database
* Call Firebase and get sheet data
* Store sheet data in state
* Render sheet
* accept new data to state
* Save new data to firebase

Optionals:

  -query database
  -store data
  -display data
  -use router to organise other sheets access?
  
 Week 1: Basic database access and rendering
 Week 2: Store sheet changes & create new sheets
 Week 3: Style with css, remove console.logs, add optional features if time.
